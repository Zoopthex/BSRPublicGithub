# BSRPublicGithub

Here's how to install the mod:

1. Click the green button that says "Code".
2. Click "Download as zip"
3. When finished downloading, unzip the file. You should get a folder named "BSRPublicGithub". If it isn't named that, rename it to be that.
4. When unzipped move the folder:
    - If on Windows, move it to: C:Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod
    - If on Mac, move it to: Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/Hearts of Iron IV/mod
5. When the folder "BSRPublicGithub" is in the folder "mod" take the file "BSRPublicGithub.mod" (it is located inside "BSRPublicGithub") and move it out of the folder
   and into the folder "mod". This is the same folder where "BSRPublicGithub" is located.
6. The mod should now be installed correctly.
